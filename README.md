How the CORDIC Algorithm Works
The CORDIC algorithm iteratively rotates a vector towards the desired angle by a sequence of predetermined rotations. These rotations are based on binary shifts, making the algorithm highly efficient in hardware implementations, as it avoids multipliers and uses only addition, subtraction, and bit-shifting operations.

Applications
Digital signal processing (DSP)
Embedded systems
Robotics (angle calculations)
Graphics (3D rotations)
Telecommunications (modulation and demodulation)

CORDIC Algorithm Overview

The CORDIC algorithm works by iteratively rotating a vector toward a desired angle through a series of predetermined shifts and additions. It eliminates the need for multiplication by relying on binary shifts, making it highly efficient for hardware implementations.

Key Operation Flow:
Initialize vector coordinates.
Apply iterative rotations based on the desired angle.
Use shift-and-add operations to compute trigonometric results.
