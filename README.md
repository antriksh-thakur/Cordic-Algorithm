# Cordic-Algorithm

The CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer) algorithm is a highly efficient method for computing trigonometric functions, widely used in various digital signal processing
applications. This report presents the implementation of the CORDIC algorithm using Verilog HDL, targeting FPGA platforms. The implementation focuses on calculating sine and cosine functions, leveraging the iterative nature of the CORDIC algorithm to achieve accurate results with minimal resource utilization. The design was synthesized and simulated to evaluate performance metrics such as accuracy, speed, and hardware resource usage. The results demonstrate that the CORDIC algorithm provides high precision with low latency, making it suitable for real-time applications. Additionally, the resource efficiency of the implementation allows it to be used in systems with limited hardware resources. The report also discusses potential optimizations and future extensions, including the implementation of other mathematical functions and integration into more complex systems. The findings suggest that the Verilog HDL implementation of the CORDIC algorithm is a robust and versatile solution for hardware-based trigonometric computation, with broad applicability in the fields of digital signal processing, communications, and computer graphics.


Methodology of CORDIC Algorithm in Verilog
Initialization Stage:

Start by defining the input data, which includes angle, sine, and cosine values. Inputs are typically represented in fixed-point format to ensure precision.
Initialize the registers for storing the intermediate values of sine, cosine, and the current angle. Set the iteration index to zero, and define the number of iterations required for convergence based on the desired precision.

Iteration Process:

The algorithm iteratively rotates the input angle by either adding or subtracting pre-defined angles. These rotations are done using a series of bit-shift operations, representing division by powers of two. For each iteration, the algorithm decides whether to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise based on the current angle. Update the sine and cosine values after each rotation based on the direction and magnitude of the angle.

Control Logic:

A state machine is implemented to control the flow of the algorithm, ensuring that each step of the iteration is executed in sequence. The state machine manages the computation of intermediate results and determines when the algorithm has converged to the desired precision.

Data Path Design:

The data path includes shift-adders for implementing the bit-shift operations required in each iteration. Separate blocks for sine and cosine calculations are designed, which continuously update during each iteration based on the control signals from the state machine.

Termination Condition:

The algorithm terminates after a predefined number of iterations or when the angle has been reduced below a threshold, indicating convergence. At the end of the iterations, the sine and cosine values represent the final computed values for the given input angle.

Output Stage:

Once the iterations are complete, the final sine and cosine values are available as outputs. These results are stored in output registers, which can be accessed by other parts of the system or external interfaces.
